ELB stands for Elastic Load Balancer.

Elastic - Means it can expand and contract dynamically.

Load Balancer - Means it directs traffic from a single entry point to multiple servers behind it.

Not a single server that routes traffic through it (would not scale to 1000 servers now would it?) More like a supervised DNS entry... You ask for DNS Entry X you get back an IP from the pool.

GOTCHA: Stopping and starting an instance is a gotcha... if the ip address changes, the ELB does not recognize the instance any more because the public ip changes... Elastic IPs, strangely, do not seem to help. 

	
Demo:

Two instances running. Both have Tomcat running serving up a page that identifies each server.

When we are done we should see a page that flip flops between Test 1 and Test 2.

Create Load Balancer. 

    Internal vs External ELB.

    Load Balancer ports vs instance ports
    
    Health Check - give it a url that must return an HTTP 200. Watchout for redirects! Got burned by this. It does to follow redirects. Did /helloworld instead of /helloworld/index.jsp
    
    Security Groups
    
    Add Instances
    
    Notes: Health Checks are continuous.
