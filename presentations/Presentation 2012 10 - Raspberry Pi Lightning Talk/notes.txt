Raspberry PI is a full on computer. It rocks a 700mhz processor and HD playback supporting GPU. 256 MB of RAM.

Model A ($25) / Model B ($35)

Difference is a Ethernet Port and a second USB port. Both have HDMI and Analog video out, headphone jack, and micro USB power.

Runs various distributions of Linux and other systems flashed to a SD card. Can use "dd" command in Linux / Mac to format SD card or Win32DiskImager for Windows.

Starting out there is a nice distribution of Debian optimized for Raspberry Pi and preconfigured with some development tools (mostly Python based) called "Raspian" or "Wheezy".

Current projects to port XMBC and Android (2.3 and 4.0). Expecting Android release soon (this month?)
