Raspberry Pi

    http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1417

    Had to run: sudo apt-get install python-dev

Issues:

    Keyboard reconfigure: sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
    
    Installed VIM: (sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get vim-runtime, sudo apt-get vim)

    Use resistors on inputs between them an ground, otherwise you have nothing anchoring the voltage
    
    Font size: dpkg-reconfigure console-setup
