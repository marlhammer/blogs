Raspberry Pi
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Raspberry Pi is a hardware platform. Driving an active community of hobbyists and education institutions because of its low cost ($25 to $35), small size, and low power draw. 

It is a general purpose, fully functional, high level computer. It is not a low level microcontroller like an Arduino or Beagle Board. 

Technical specifications:

    CPU (700 MHz to 1 GHz)
    GPU (HDMI output)
    256 mb to 512 mb of RAM
    SD card slot for system storage and OS image
    
Raspberry Pi architecture is based on ARM instruction set, and therefore can support any ARM compatible OS. 

Reference (and quite robust!) distribution is "Raspbian" a port of Debian. Can also support other flavors of Linux (ARCH, Fedora), as well as other operating systems (Android ports, Firefox OS ports, XBMC (which is linux based).

Demo:

    Show website.
    
    Show how to flash OS.
    
    Show setup of Raspberry Pi.
    
        - All system settings
        
        - Setting up SSH / static IP
        
        - PuTTY log in
        
        - Install packages
        
        - Updated software and OS
        
Raspberry Pi bridges the gap between high level and low level programming. Arduinos are great for embedded systems / microcontrollers / low level but lack higher order functions.

Raspberry Pi has GPIO ports.

Quick Python intro.

Demonstration GPIO control with Raspberry Pi.

Mention SSH access via Android / iOS apps.
