
Maker movement. Making electronics (or anything) accessible to a broader audience and using those things to create your own projects.

Split talk into two parts, one for Raspberry Pi (less hands on) and one for Arduino (more hands on).

Intro to Raspberry Pi:

    Full computer
    Runs Linux
    Cheap!
    Can do GPIO (fun!)
    
Intro to Arduino:

    Microcontroller. Not a full computer.
    Simple programs (limited memory)
    Just GPIO, but cheap, light, low power consumption
    Runs in C
    We will play with these today!

Overview / Demo of Raspberry Pi:

    Show raspberrypi.org
    
    Install OS. (Talk about NOOBS?)
    
    Configure OS (Locale and keyboard!)
    
    Font size: dpkg-reconfigure console-setup

    Show SSH configuration.
    
    Show IP address configuration. (Discuss static IP address!)
    
    Show off camera (raspistill -o file.jpg or raspivid -o video.h264)
    
    Ask about Python demo / learning?
    
    Show off GPIO.
    
    Show off Temp/Humidity sensor.
    
    Talk about other distributions (XMBC, Arduino, Kali Linux)

Overview / Demo of Arduino:

    Install software. (http://www.arduino.cc/)
    
    Description of the hardware (shields, etc.)
    
    Electronics lesson:
    
        Power/Ground
        
        Resistors
        
        Breadboard
        
        LEDs
        
    Show simple blink
    
    Show wired LED
    
    Turn them loose (an LED bank, stop light, digit are all valid, analog dim LED!)
