Shortened version of chalk talk.

Some technical things we are skipping:

    Python introduction.
    XPath introduction.
    Nitty gritty of Scrapy (Python Web Crawling library.)

    See my blog for the technical goodness and if there is interest I can give the full technical chalk talk.

Tackled this project as a representative cross section of different Sequoia projects:

    Web Crawling (OSC work)
    Python (Data Science work)
    Neo4J (Big Data work)
        Kudos to David Swearingen. Neo4J is a "graph" database. Discuss identity resolution.
    AWS (core capability)

Project would crawl IMDB, alternating ingesting Actors and Movies and build a graph of Actor/Movie relationships.

Web Scraping:

    Scrapy

        Items
        Item Pipelines
        Spiders

DEMO code.

DEMO project.

Thoughts on web scraping:

    Pruning and controlling the crawl is a problem! (How to avoid loops!)

    General purpose vs specialized trade off.

Sandbox for people to play with.
