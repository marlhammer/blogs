Introduction to Python

    Taxonomy:
    
        Interpreted, but can be compiled (and cross compiled).
    
        Dynamic typing.
    
        Functional and OO.

    Some unique features:
    
        Whitespace sensitive.
        
        Split between Python 2 and 3.

Introduction to XPath

    Way of referring to HTML tree elements. Similar to (predecessor of?) CSS selectors.

    Plugin: Control-Shift-X, then Shift
    
    Show a few examples on www.google.com

       //input (11 results)
       //input[@type='text']
       //input[@value='Google Search']
       //a[contains(@href, 'youtube')]/text()
    
    Show introduction:

        / implies next element
        // implies ANY next element

        [] for attributes

        Special Operations can be applied values
        
        Special "Axes" can be referenced
        
        text()

    Can return many results or a single result.

Web Scraping:

    Scrapy
    
        Items
        Item Pipelines
        Spiders
        
    Project: CCG Card
    
    Project: IMDB 6 Degrees of X

Thoughts on web scraping:

    Controlling it is a problem!
    
    General purpose vs specialized trade off.
