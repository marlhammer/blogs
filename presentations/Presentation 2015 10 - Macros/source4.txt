Problem: I want to generate JSON object with these fields.

JSONObject json = new JSONObject();
json.add("fname", fname);
...

Key Point: Copy paste state is maintained within the macro.

Key Point: Doing MOST of the work is good enough. Can decorate with some details (like toString() at the end) later.



private String fName;
private String lName;
private String mName;
private int age;
private int weight;
private String ssn;
private String telephoneNumber;
private Color hairColor;
private Color eyeColor;
private double bmi;
private int footsizeMetric;
private int footsizeEnglish;
private boolean isTerrorist;
