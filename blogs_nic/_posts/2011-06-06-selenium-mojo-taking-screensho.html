In general Selenium and JUnit mix very well. One of the few areas where I have had problems getting them to play well with each other is when I wanted JUnit to notify Selenium when a test failed.<br /><br />JUnit has a couple mechanisms for catching test failures but all these methods fire after the test is torn down. Since I typically shutdown Selenium in the test tearDown() method (or its @After annotated equivalent) it is too late to ask Selenium to capture a screenshot. <br /><br />My solution has been to capture a screenshot after every test instead of just trying to do it on failures or errors. <br /><br />Initially I had trouble capturing the screenshots because there is also no easy way to get JUnit to tell you which test just completed. Naturally I wanted to name the screenshots after the tests. <br /><br />Thankfully in JUnit 4.7 a set of test "rules" were added (see the <a href="https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/raw/23ffc6baf5768057e366e183e53f4dfa86fbb005/doc/ReleaseNotes4.7.txt">release notes</a>) which included a mechanism for capturing the currently executing test name.<br /><br />The code for this is below. I recommend putting this code in a test base class that all your Selenium tests can inherit.<br /><br />

{% highlight javascript %}
@Rule
public TestName testName = new TestName()

@After
public void tearDown() {
  try {
    selenium.windowFocus()
    selenium.captureScreenshot("<YOUR PATH>\\${testName.getMethodName()}-${getClass().getSimpleName()}.png")
  } catch (Exception e) {
    // Swallow the exception to prevent double error reporting in the JUnit report.
  }
  selenium.stop()
{% endhighlight %}<br /><br />

Note: I find it helpful to print the method name first followed by the class because the JUnit report is displayed method name first making the screenshots easier to cross reference.<br /><br />Note: If you are running your tests on Windows and your workstation screen is locked you will get a black screen for a screenshot. I have searched long and hard and there appears to be no workaround for this on Windows. It is considered a security vulnerability. If you are running on Linux you can use virtual frame buffer to simulate a screen while running headless.<br /><br />
