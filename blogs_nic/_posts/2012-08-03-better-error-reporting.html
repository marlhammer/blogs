Recently I have been writing a lot of bash shell scripts to orchestrate hierarchies of jobs running on a batch processing cluster. I ran into several times where, in the middle of a complex script, a single step would fail. Instead of terminating, the shell script would continue executing, causing a cascade of confusing errors in subsequent steps.<br/><br/>

Incidentally, many of these failures were due to typos I had made in shell script variable names. By default if the shell sees a variable that is not bound it resolves it to a blank string instead of throwing an error, which can cause havoc if that value is required for a step or later steps to execute correctly.<br/><br/>

After some searching, I found that bash shell scripts have several flags that can be set using the "set" command. (I highly recommend the man page on "set" to anyone who is doing serious shell script work as there are a lot of useful flags in there!) The two flags that helped me the most were the "e" and "u" flags. These can be set at any point in your script by calling "set -eu".<br/><br/>

The "-e" flag will cause the script to terminate with a nonzero exit code if any later commands fail. This causes the script to fail fast instead of risking a cascade of failures.<br/><br/>

Using the "-e" option introduces some fragility to your shell scripts. Any command that fails will stop your script. In my case I had one place in my script where I was trying to kill and restart a certain process. Things worked well at first, until the process I was trying to kill crashed before my script ran. Since the process I was trying to kill was not running it caused the call to "kill" to fail which in turn terminated my script unexpectedly.<br/><br/>

If you have a command that might be expected to fail harmlessly in some circumstances, you have two workarounds you can use. One option is to use the fact that the "-e" flag ignores failures in conditionals (such as if statements). Thus if you want to protect a command from the "-e" flag you can wrap it with a "\|\| true" condition. My case above I could have written my command like "kill ${SOME_PID} \|\| true" and prevented the failed call to "kill" from stopping the script.<br/><br/>

A second option is to temporarily disable the "-e" flag using the command "set +e". You can call "set +e", issue one or more commands, then call "set -e" to resume strict failure checking.<br/><br/>

Using the "-u" option forces the shell script to fail if it encounters an unbound variable. This allows you to find typos very easily while created or modifying a shell script. The one major gotcha I found using the "-u" flag happened when I was trying to handle optional command line arguments. Attempting to reference an optional command line argument (such as "MY_VAR = $1") stopped my script when the user did not supply a value for the argument. To work around this I just set the "-u" after my command line argument handling code. I could also have used "set +u" to turn off strict variable checking for the portion of code that handled command line arguments.<br/><br/>
