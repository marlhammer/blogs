An Android application, referred to as a "task" in Google parlance, is comprised of one or more Activity objects which interact with each other in a workflow to represent your application to the user. Each Activity is responsible for defining its own layout, components, and so forth. Depending on the actions a user takes in an Activity, it can also launch other activities by firing sending an Intent object to the Android OS. Intents specify that the current activity wants to start another activity (which can reside either in the current application or in another application.) An activity can pass data to the other activity through the Intent object as well.

Most Android Apps you write will have more than one activity. These activities are usually organized in some sort of workflow. For example, consider a simple email application as an example. You might have one activity to represent the Inbox. Clicking on an email in the Inbox might fire an intent to open another activity to view that email. Clicking the Reply button in the view email acitivty might fire an intent to open another acitivity to send a reply email.
<br/><br/>


Activities are tracked by the Android OS in a stack. When you fire an Intent for a new Activity that Activity is created and placed on the activity stack.
<br/><br/>

Of course most workflows are not one directional. So you will quickly find cases that you want to go "back" to a previous activity on the stack. This might be because the current activity is finished, or because the user changed their mind and wants to just go back a step.

Outline:

Back one step: super.finish();

Back more than one step:  Launch intent and use flags

Good practice to implement onSavedState method
