<font style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>Introduction</b></font>
<br /><br />

On my current project we have been involved in converting some of the hundreds of manual tests that are run by our Test Team every release into a suite of automated Selenium RC tests.<br /><br />

During the course of this adventure my crew found several instances where XPath and native JavaScript were not sufficiently expressive to find elements in some of our more complicated interfaces. <br /><br />Since our web app uses the Prototype/Scriptaculous JavaScript framework we wanted to find a way to make the locating power of Prototype available within Selenium RC.<br /><br />We developed approaches for both Selenium 0.9.2 and Selenium 1.0.3 (which had better programmatic support for adding JavaScript user extensions to Selenium).<br /><br /><br /><font style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>Selenium 0.9.2</b></font><br /><br />Selenium RC provides the capability to add "user extensions" to augment its JavaScript core. <br /><br />See <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/docs/08_user_extensions.html">http://seleniumhq.org/docs/08_user_extensions.html</a> for detailed information on how to set this up. <br /><br />We wrote the following user-extension.js file:<br /><br />

{% highlight javascript %}
Selenium.prototype.setupProtoypeJS = function() {
  id = selenium.browserbot.getCurrentWindow().$;
  css = selenium.browserbot.getCurrentWindow().$$;
}
{% endhighlight %}<br /><br />

In our code we have a base class for all our test cases. To this we added our own waitForPage() method:<br /><br />

{% highlight javascript %}
public void waitForPage() {
  selenium.waitForPage('60000')
  proc.doCommand('setupPrototypeJS', [])
}
{% endhighlight %}<br /><br />

Thus every time the page reloads (which clears the JavaScript context) we call waitForPage() and this command is re-executed. It creates two global variables (id and css) and binds them to Prototype's $ and $$ functions respectively.<br /><br /><i>Note: The reason we choose id and css instead of $ and $$ was that Groovy considers $ in Strings to be a special character and we would have had to escape it each time it was used</i>.<br /><br />The Prototype selectors can now be used in Selenium RC like this:<br /><br />

{% highlight javascript %}
selenium.click("dom=id('foo')")
selenium.click("dom=css('.bar')")
selenium.click("dom=css('span.foo a.baz')")
{% endhighlight %}<br /><br />
<i>Note: You still have to specify the dom locator type so Selenium RC will know to execute your locator string as JavaScript.&nbsp; <br /></i><br /><br /><font style="font-size: 1.25em;"><b>Selenium 1.0.3</b></font><br /><br />In more recent version of Selenium RC the project added the setExtensionJs() method. This allows you to set extension JavaScript programmatically prior to starting the selenium client:<br /><br />

{% highlight javascript %}
selenium = new DefaultSelenium(...)
selenium.setExtensionJs('...')
selenium.start()
{% endhighlight %}<br /><br />

This made it much easier to implement our Prototype bindings. The only trick was that the JavaScript seems to be executed prior to having access to a page context and is also only executed once. This required us to take a different approach.<br /><br />We created id and css as global functions instead of variables. This allowed us to defer accessing the current window until the functions were actually invoked. &nbsp; <br /><br />

{% highlight javascript %}
selenium.setExtensionJs('''
  id = function(value) {
    return selenium.browserbot.getCurrentWindow().$(value);
  }

  css = function(value) {
    return selenium.browserbot.getCurrentWindow().$$(value);
  }
''');
{% endhighlight %} <br /><i>Note: The above code snippet is written in Groovy which allows multiline Strings.<br /></i><br />The Prototype selectors are used in Selenium RC like before:<br /><br />

{% highlight javascript %}
selenium.click("dom=id('foo')")
selenium.click("dom=css('.bar')")
selenium.click("dom=css('span.foo a.baz')")
{% endhighlight %}<br /><br />
